        <h2>The Tragic Tale of Peppe Peligroso</h2>

        <p>
            In a dusty village under the scorching sun of the Mexican desert, tranquility was shattered by the sinister
            arrival of Se√±ora Galina and her relentless army of chickens and chicks. The villagers could only watch in
            horror as feathers filled the air and chaos reigned in their arid home. But one brave soul, Peppe Peligroso,
            refused to surrender. Armed with his legendary leaps and fiery bottles of red salsa, he vowed to defend his
            desert village at all costs.

            Now, the fate of this sunbaked village rests in your hands. Will you help Peppe defeat the feathery menace
            and restore peace to the desert sands? The path to victory is not easy, but with courage and skill, you can
            turn the tide. Below, you'll find the instructions to join Peppe in his battle against the clucking horde.
